The WebBrewery is a project I did in 2000 as an easy way to create and maintain
web sites. The main idea was to create static web pages from some templating
system augmented with a little bit of extra magic, so that changing links or
maintaining navigation or site maps can be done with almost no effort.

I used the WebBrewery for a couple of web sites I maintained back then at the
Heidelberg University. On top of that it was a deep learning dive into
Makefiles and Perl for me.

Now, 13 years later, I'm amazed that the code still works out of the box. A lot
of the concepts are still valid today. There are a number of projects, which do
the same based on a more modern (and possibly saner) choice of technology. So
while the world has moved the code might still be interesting as a curiosity and
an artefact from my programming history.

You can find the home page and documentation at
