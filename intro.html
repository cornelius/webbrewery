<H1>Introduction to the WebBrewery</H1>

<P>The WebBrewery is a system for creating web pages. It takes care of the
annoying tasks of web page design like maintaining links or consistent layout of
the pages. You will need to know what you are doing when using the WebBrewery,
but it will pay off. If you are afraid of Perl, Makefiles or even HTML,
you will become happier with some other tools.</P>

<P>The basic principle of the WebBrewery is that you don't duplicate redundant
data. You use templates to create the parts of your web pages which are always
the same, you use central link, data and figure definition files to maintain
your references to other URLs and figures.</P>

<P>The boring aspects of web page creation are the job of the brewery. Despite
the templates and central files you just provide the pure HTML source code for
your pages, containing only the information you want to publish, not the
redundant headers, layout stuff, navigation elements or explicit URLs.
This makes management of your
web site easy. The WebBrewery takes care of actual creation of web pages,
insertion of links, layout, navigation and some other details, you don't want
to care about.
</P>

<P>This documentation was also created with the WebBrewery. Its source is
included with the distribution. Also a small example project is included. Have a
look at this example code when in doubt of the exact function of the
scripts.</P>

<P>What you have to know in order to efficiently use the WebBrewery is collected
in this documentaion pages. The organisation of the scripts and data is
described, detailed information about the format of the configuration files is
given and a complete reference of used symbols is provided.</P>

<P>Note that the WebBrewery is an open-source project. This means that you can
help making the WebBrewer a better tool by providing comments, bug-reports,
suggestions, patches or whatever you feel to be appropriate.</P>

<P>I hope you have some fun with the WebBrewery.</P>
