<H1>What is the WebBrewery?</H1>

<P>You write the code for your web pages by hand? But you also want to have a
consistent look, navigation elements, management of links and more?</P>

<P>Then the WebBrewery is for you. It helps you to "brew" your web pages.
You provide the ingredients and the WebBrewery takes care of the actual
generation of the pages. The results are pretty, consistent and easy to
maintain. And you retain complete control over the HTML code.</P>

They are generated by the WebBrewery. The source files to build all this are
