<H1>About the WebBrewery</H1>

<P>The WebBrewery is a system for creating web pages. It is powerful, complex
and can make your life easy. It can also cause
nervous breakdowns, if you expect it to save the effort to learn the
techniques required to create good web pages. You will not get along without
knowing HTML and at least the very basics of Make and Perl.</P>

<P>I use the WebBrewery to create my own web pages. I do this because I found no
other tool, which fitted my vision of web pages. Since the results seem to be
of some quality, several people asked me, if they could use my tools. That's the
reason why you can read this. I decided to make a public release of the
WebBrewery for all the people, who are tired of WYSYWIG, who know what they are
doing, when creating webpages, and who just want to get rid of the annoying
aspects of webpage creation.</P>

<P>Technically the WebBrewery is a collection of Perl-Scripts, controlled by a
central Makefile. These scripts collect the information you provide by some raw
HTML source files and some more control text files. They generate all the data
your webserver needs to show your pages to the world. The tedious tasks, like
making sure that links work and are consistent, are done by the scripts. You
can concentrate on writing nice HTML-code expressing the ideas, thoughts,
knowledge, etc. you want to publish on your webserver.</P>

<H2>The Author</H2>

<P>My name is Cornelius Schumacher. I started to develop the WebBrewery for my
own homepage in 2000. Back then I worked at the <A --LINK:atlas-->ATLAS
project</A>, a big high-energy
physics experiment taking place at <A --LINK:cern-->CERN</A> at Genf. This is,
by the way, the place where the world wide web was invented. The <A
--LINK:atlashd:old-->Heidelberg web pages of
ATLAS</A> were one application of the WebBrewery.</P>

<P>There are some other projects I work on and some other web pages I have
created. You will find all of these, if you look at the web. If you would like
to <A --LINK:mail:cornelius-->contact me</A> send an e-mail.</P>

<P>I hope, the WebBrewery can be of help for you. Have some fun with it!</P>
