<h1>Organisation of Data</h1>

<P>The WebBrewery uses three directories, a <em>project</em> directory, a
<em>local preview</em> directory and a <em>public</em> directory.<P>

<p>The <em>project</em> directory contains all control files. The page
source files are contained in a sub-directory <code>src</code>. The following
control files are used:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><CODE>Makefile</CODE>: This is used by the GNU make utility to generate
  the HTML output. It contains the settings for the output directories. The user
  should edit this file to adapt it to his needs.</LI>
  
  <LI><CODE>brew.conf</CODE>: The WebBrewery configuration file. It contains
  settings like filenames and suffices or switches for contents generation. The
  user might want to edit this file to adapt to his needs.</LI>

  <LI><B>Index Files</B>: These files form the database of information relevant
  to your site, which is not associated with an individual page. There are index
  files for the structure of the site
  (<A --LINK:this:files:content--><CODE>projectname.content</CODE></A>),
  link URLs (<A --LINK:this:files:links--><CODE>projectname.links</CODE></A>),
  image URLs (<A --LINK:this:files:figs--><CODE>projectname.figs</CODE></A>)
  and data files
  (<A --LINK:this:files:data--><CODE>projectname.data</CODE></A>).
  </LI>
  
  <LI><B>Template Files</B>: The appearance of the web site is represented by
  one or more template files, which contain the HTML code defining the layout
  and common elements of all pages of a web-site. Usually these template files
  provide the standard HTML header, navigation elements and some optical
  elements as frame for the content. By using appropriate templates it is very
  easy to create web pages with a consistent look and feel. The standard file
  suffix for templae files is <CODE>.tmpl.html</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The source files provide the content of the web site. They don´t contain
redundant information like common layout and navigation elements or actual URLs.
The separation of content on one side and templates and project database on
the other hand allows you to concentrate on what is important: The information
you want to provide to the people visiting your web-site.</P>

<P>The <em>local preview</em> output directory is used for HTML output during
development. It allows to check and test the results of the page generation
without touching the public versions of your pages. To generate
the preview version of HTML output use the command:</P>
<P class=indent><KBD>make all</KBD>.</P>

<P>The <em>public</em> output directory is used as destination, when generating
public versions of your web-site. It can either be the actual directory your web
server reads or the source for some mirroring to the location accessible by the
web server. This mirroring is not (yet) provided by the WebBrewery. To generate
the public version of HTML output use the command:</P>
<P class=indent><KBD>make public</KBD>.</P>
