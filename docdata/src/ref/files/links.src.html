<H1>The Link File</H1>

<P>The link file contains definitions of hyperlinks. Each definition defines a
link symbol, which can be used in the source files and a destination, pointing
to an internal or external web page or other ressource.</P>

<P>A line of the link file has the following format defining one link:</P>

<P class=indent>
  <CODE>linksymbol linkdestination</CODE>
</P>

<P>The linksymbol may contain alphanumeric and <em>underscore</em>,
<em>colon</em> and <em>dot</em> characters (<B><TT>:./</TT></B>).</P>

<P>If the linkdestination starts with <code>this:</code> it points to an internal
web page and is interpreted as relative path. If the linkdestination is
<code>*</code> it equals the linksymbol. All other linkdestinations are
interpreted as references to external web pages and are prefixed with
<code>http://</code>.</P>

<P>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments and define no link
symbol. Empty lines are ignored.</P>

<P>I recommend to use some kind of hierarchical naming scheme for the linksymbols,
for example by prefixing the linksymbols with a category and if required
additional subcategories seperated by colons. An example would be:</P>

<P class=indent>
  <CODE>w3:html:spec4 www.w3.org/TR/html4/</CODE>
</P>

<P>And another advice: Use the link file and don't put URLs in your source code.
It may look easier in some cases at first sight,  but you will regret it later,
when maintenance of changing links becomes a nightmare.</P>
