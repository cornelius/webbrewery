<H1>The Content File</H1>

<P>This is the central configuration file defining the overall structure of the
web site. A list of source file and the hierarchy used for organising them is
contained in this file.</P>

<P>Each line of the content file contains an entry specifying one web page. It
has the form:</P>

<P class=indent>
  <CODE>&gt;&gt;-filename pagename --TEMPLATE:templatefile --SUFFIX:filesuffix</CODE>
</P>

<P><code>filename</code> is the name of the source file of the web page. It has to
include the path relative to the source file directory but does not include the
source and HTML extension.</P>

<P><code>pagename</code> is the name of the page that
appears in the title tag and in the output generated by <code>CONTENT</code> and
<code>SITEMAP</code>
symbols. It may contain white spaces.</P>

<P>If the content file line begins with one or more <code>&gt;</code>
characters it
means that the corresponding page is a subpage on the level given by the number
of <code>&gt;</code> characters. This information is used when processing
<code>CONTENT</code>
and <code>SITEMAP</code> symbols.</P>

<P>Between <code>&gt;</code> characters and the filename there may be present
one <code>-</code> character. If it is present, the page is created but not
included in the content output. But it is used for sitemap output and links
in the navigation bar.</P>

<P>The <code>--TEMPLATE:tempatefile</code> and <code>--SUFFIX:filesuffix</code>
are optional. If present the TEMPLATE option specifies a template file to be
used instead of the default template defined in <tt>brew.conf</tt>. The SUFFIX
option is used to specify a suffix for the name of source and generated file,
which is used instead of the default ones defined in <tt>brew.conf</tt>.

<P>A line beginning with a <code>#</code> character is treated as comment and
not processed.
White spaces between the different parts of the content file entries can be used
for formatting.</P>
