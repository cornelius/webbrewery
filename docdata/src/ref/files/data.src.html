<H1>The Data File</H1>

<P>The data file defines data resources, i.e. data files not subject to
processing by the WebBrewery. Each line of the data file defines a data
ressource using the following format:</P>

<P class=indent>
  <CODE>OPERATION: location</CODE>
</P>

<P>There are two kinds of operations: <code>COPY:</code> means that the
resource (a file or directory) at the given location is copied from the
<code>src</code> directory to
the output directory. <code>LINK:</code> means that the resource (a file or
directory) is linked from the output directory to the given location unless it
already exists as real file or directory at the output directory.</P>
