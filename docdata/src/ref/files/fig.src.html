<H1>The Figures File</H1>

<P>The figure file contains definitions of symbols for figure resources, i.e.
images. Each line defines one figure resource. Its format is</P>

<P class=indent>
  <CODE>figuresymbol figurelocation</CODE>
</P>

<P>The figuresymbol defines a symbol, which can be used in the source file with
the <code>FIG:</code> symbol. The figurelocation defines the address of the
figure ressource. It is interpreted local unless a URL starting with
<code>http://</code> is given. I recommend using a hierachical naming scheme for
the symbols as described for the link symbols (see <A
--LINK:this:files:links-->Link File</A>).</P>

<P>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments and define no link
symbol. Empty lines are ignored.</P>
