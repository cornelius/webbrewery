<H1>WebBrewery Setup</H1>

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

<P>You will need Perl and GNU-Make. You will also need an editor to edit your
HTML source files. Any text editor will do it, but an editor, which helps with
special symbols like &lt;,&gt;,&auml;,&szlig; or &copy;, which require a special
representation in HTML will make your life more convenient.</P>

<H2>Installing</H2>

<P>Unzip and extract the archive to a location you are comfortable with. Then
set the environment variable <code>WEBBREWERYDIR</code> to this location,
preferably in your <code>.bashrc</code>. That's all.

<H2>Setting up a new project</H2>

<P>Go to the base directory of the WebBrewery. This should be
<code>$WEBBREWERYDIR</code>.
Then call the command</P>

<P class=indent>
<kbd>./startbrewery &lt;projectname&gt; &lt;projectdir&gt;</kbd>.
</P>

<P>Choose the project name and directory name as you like. This will create
you a template of your new project in the project directory. Start from these
files and modify and extend them.</P>

<P>To specify some directories and files the brewery uses, e.g. the output
directory, edit the <code>Makefile</code> in the project directory. Another file you
might want to edit is <code>brew.conf</code>, also located in the project
directory.
It contains some settings to customize the creation of your web pages.</P>
